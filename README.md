# EHT Sgr A* Theory Paper Analysis Tools

This repository contains tools and Jupyter notebooks for data analysis
and visualization for the EHT Sgr A* Theory Paper.
Instead of using custom libraries such as
[`hallmark`](https://github.com/l6a/hallmark)
and
[`mockservation`](https://github.com/focisrc/mockservation),
we put all the dependent functions in the "common/" directory.
This makes this repository easy to use and self-contain.
